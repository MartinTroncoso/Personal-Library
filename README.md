# Personal Library

This application allows the user to search for any book available in the Google Books API and store it within his/her personal library. The person will be able to see all the books that have been saved, having each one a determined level of visibility:
* ALL_PAGES > The entire book is available for free to read.
* PARTIAL > Only the first pages can be read, to read the rest, the user has to buy the book.
* NO_PAGES > No pages available to read, neither free nor paying.
